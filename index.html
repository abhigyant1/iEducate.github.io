            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education is a process of learning through which we acquire knowledge.
                It enlightens, empowers, and creates a positive development. Education gives an individual the knowledge
                and skills to work with virtue. It aids the all-round mental, physical, and intellectual growth and
                development of an individual.

                There are three distinct types of Education- Formal Education, Non-Formal Education, and Informal
                Education. Education aims to change the way of one’s thinking. Academic knowledge provides one leaning
                on a global scale, while Practical knowledge is acquired for life on the whole.

                Education is imparted to all, at various research and academic institutions, imparted by teachers,
                professors, and trainers.These institutions conduct various curricular activities that aid the overall
                growth and development of students. Education is a highly essential tool that helps you irrespective of
                the age- whether you are a child or a grown-up. Education is a class of learning and is achieved through
                the four walls of the school as well as at the playground. Every situation and activity we see or
                experience teaches us something.

                Education opens the door of opportunities for an individual to choose. It imparts our perception and
                directs us the right path with multiple viewpoints and opens the runways the success.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education is a purposeful activity directed at achieving certain aims,
                such as transmitting knowledge or fostering skills and character traits. These aims may include the
                development of understanding, rationality, kindness, and honesty. Various researchers emphasize the role
                of critical thinking in order to distinguish education from indoctrination. Some theorists require that
                education results in an improvement of the student while others prefer a value-neutral definition of the
                term. In a slightly different sense, education may also refer, not to the process, but to the product of
                this process: the mental states and dispositions possessed by educated people. Education originated as
                the transmission of cultural heritage from one generation to the next. Today, educational goals
                increasingly encompass new ideas such as the liberation of learners, skills needed for modern society,
                empathy, and complex vocational skills.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small"> Formal education takes place in education and training institutions, is
                usually structured by curricular aims and objectives, and learning is typically guided by a teacher. In
                most regions, formal education is compulsory up to a certain age and commonly divided into educational
                stages such as kindergarten, primary school and secondary school. Nonformal education occurs as addition
                or alternative to formal education.It may be structured according to educational arrangements, but in a
                more flexible manner, and usually takes place in community-based, workplace-based or civil society-based
                settings. Lastly, informal education occurs in daily life, in the family, any experience that has a
                formative effect on the way one thinks, feels, or acts may be considered educational, whether
                unintentional or intentional. In practice there is a continuum from the highly formalized to the highly
                informalized, and informal learning can occur in all three settings.For instance, homeschooling can be
                classified as nonformal or informal, depending upon the structure.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Many agree that education is a purposeful activity directed at achieving
                certain aims, especially the transmission of knowledge.But they often include other aims as well, such
                as fostering skills and character traits.However, there are deep disagreements about the exact nature of
                education besides these general characteristics. According to some conceptions, it is primarily a
                process that occurs during events like schooling, teaching, and learning.Others understand it not as a
                process but as the achievement or product brought about by this process. On this view, education is what
                educated persons have, i.e. the mental states and dispositions that are characteristic of them.</p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
                However, the term may also refer to the academic study of the methods and processes taking place during
                teaching and learning, as well as the social institutions involved in these processes.Etymologically,
                the word "education" is derived from the Latin word ēducātiō ("A breeding, a bringing up, a rearing")
                from ēducō ("I educate, I train") which is related to the homonym ēdūcō ("I lead forth, I take out; I
                raise up, I erect") from ē- ("from, out of") and dūcō ("I lead, I conduct").</p>
